### secure and/or private chat with Deno

In this example we us ed2curve to send private messages between ed25519 keypairs.

The message protocol is the same as the one used by [bogbook](https://github.com/evbogue/bogbook).

Run it on your local:

```
deno run --allow-all --unstable serve.js
```

Try it on Deno Deploy:
